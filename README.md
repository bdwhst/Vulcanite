# Vulcanite

### Dependencies
- metis
- assimp
- OpenMesh

### Build

For now, we only test on Windows.

For windows users, we recommend that you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install dependencies.

If you have successfully installed all dependencies through vcpkg, then this program should be able to run normally. 

TODO: Windows, not using vcpkg

TODO: Linux

### Log

11.8

> We will not use OpenMesh to load mesh anymore. Consider using assimp.
Two reasons mainly:
1. OpenMesh is too slow.
	- 50 seconds to load `dragon.obj`. 800k faces
	- 6 seonds to load `bunny.obj`. 60k faces
2. If we want to use half-edge data structure, that would require us to maintain this structure after every mesh simplification. Gonna bring a lot of problem.

A better solution
- Use `assimp` to load obj
	- Note: `assimp` is also not very fast when loading meshes.
		- 15 seconds to load `dragon.obj`. 800k faces
		- 1.2 seonds to load `bunny.obj`. 60k faces
- Construct adjacency graph

- vkgltf -> OpenMesh -> Clustering -> Cluster Grouping -> Simplification -> Re-clustering -> ... (Until only one cluster group)

Cluster result visualization
Only test 5 clusters for now
- Incorrect?
	- Why are triangles that are not even adjacent getting assigned into the same cluster??? Is this right?
	- May need to dig deeper into graph partition part...``

11.11

This might be because that each parts of teapot are not even connected???

![Alt text](./images/teapot_inside.png)

Clustering now works fine with fixed size 32.
Howeve, the size is not fixed and it will fluctuate between 31 ~ 33.
We need to consider **if it will bring more problems**.
It should be solvable without using recursive partition?

- **Limitations**
	- Not fixed size
	- Unconnected mesh


11.12

- TODO
	- [ ] Fix unconnected mesh issues?
		- [ ] How to fix it?
	- [ ] Build the whole cpu part pipeline

Draft version of implementation
```cpp
struct Cluster{
	std::map<int, int> neighborsAndCosts;
	std::vector<uint32_t> triangles;
};

struct ClusterGroup{
	std::map<int, int> neighborsAndCosts;
	std::vector<uint32_t> boundaries;
};

struct Mesh{
	std::vector<Cluster> clusters;
	std::vector<ClusterGroup> clusterGroups;
};

struct NaniteMesh{
	uint32_t lod_nums;
	std::vector<Mesh> meshes;
};
```

11.15
Steps
- [x] Implement `Mesh` class. Generate cluster/cluster group index for lod0
- [x] Implement `Cluster` & `ClusterGroup` class
- [x] Generate cluster/cluster group info for the rest of lods
- [ ] Lock edges
- [ ] Consider refreshing cmd buffer to see clustering of each lod
- [ ] Build DAG/BVH for nanite infos.
	- Before simplification:
	- [ ] We need to store the ~~vertex~~ half-edge handles of boundaries (so that we know which face is inside)
		- [ ] This is based on the assumption that handles will still be valid after simplification
		- [ ] If we find out that handles turn out to be invalid in some cases?
			- [ ] Consider storing an extra attribute that represents the cluster group
	- After simplification:
	- [ ] With all the boundaries, we can now do a simple graph traversal
	- [ ] We need to build triangle graph first for the simplified mesh
		- [ ] Simply use non-recursive BFS
- [ ] Serialize
	- Consider
	- [ ] protobuf (High priority)
	- [ ] boost (Low priority)


11.18
- Bad News: We may use the wrong clustering step.
	- Do clustering within each cluster group.
	- How to do decimation within one cluster group?
