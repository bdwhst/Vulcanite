# Vulcanite

### Dependencies
- metis
- assimp
- OpenMesh

### Build

For now, we only test on Windows.

For windows users, we recommend that you use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install dependencies.

If you have successfully installed all dependencies through vcpkg, then this program should be able to run normally. 

TODO: Windows, not using vcpkg

TODO: Linux

> We will not use OpenMesh to load mesh anymore. Consider using assimp.
Two reasons mainly:
1. OpenMesh is too slow.
	- 50 seconds to load `dragon.obj`. 800k faces
	- 6 seonds to load `bunny.obj`. 60k faces
2. If we want to use half-edge data structure, that would require us to maintain this structure after every mesh simplification. Gonna bring a lot of problem.

A better solution
- Use `assimp` to load obj
	- Note: `assimp` is also not very fast when loading meshes.
		- 15 seconds to load `dragon.obj`. 800k faces
		- 1.2 seonds to load `bunny.obj`. 60k faces
- Construct adjacency graph
